In 1971, Virginia’s Constitution limited the General Assembly to 100 delegates and 40 senators. That constitution continued a long tradition — at least as old as 1900 — of having 100 delegates and 40 senators. However, times change. In 1900, per the U.S. Census, Virginia had 1,854,184 people. Delegates represented about 18,542 people each. Senators represented about 46,355 people each.

Today, per the U.S. Census Bureau, Virginia has 8.47 million people. Now, delegates represent about 84,700 people each. Senators represent about 211,750 people each. While the General Assembly should be commended for keeping legislative districts roughly equal in size, it’s time to revisit our legislature’s size. Rather than setting a hard limit, let’s use math.

For the House of Delegates, apply the cube root of Virginia’s population. That’s 203.84. Since having 0.84 of a legislative district is impossible, round up to 204. Every delegate would represent about 41,520 people. For the Virginia Senate, apply the fourth root of Virginia’s population. That’s 53.95. Again, since having 0.95 of a legislative district is impossible, round up to 54. Every senator would represent about 156,851 people.

Under this system, Virginia would’ve had 123 delegates and 37 senators in 1900. By 1970, Virginia would’ve had 167 delegates and 47 senators. In other words, this system is scalable. It also protects voters from having too little representation as well as too much. That problem concerned James Madison — a Virginian, our fourth president and father of the constitution. This is a solution he’d be proud of and one Virginia should make its own.

Combined with an independent redistricting commission and ranked choice voting, these reforms would make Virginia a model of American democracy.
