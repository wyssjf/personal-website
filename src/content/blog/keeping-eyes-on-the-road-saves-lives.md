Runners do not “suddenly appear,” as T.M. Sammons claims in the letter, “Runners should stick to the park.”

Consider the velocity at which runners and drivers travel. A driver will be traveling at speeds up to 45 mph on public roads, perhaps greater if the driver is speeding. A very good runner will be traveling at 10 mph (6 minutes per mile). However, it is more likely that runners will be traveling at 7.5 mph (8 minutes per mile) or slower.

Hence, it isn’t the runner who suddenly appears. It is the driver who suddenly becomes aware of the runner — often because the driver is not paying sufficient attention to the road. Perhaps the next time Sammons is on a public road, he should keep both eyes on the road, both hands on the wheel, stop at all intersections, and drive safely.

Lives are dependent upon drivers, runners, cyclists and walkers sharing the road and being safety-conscious.
